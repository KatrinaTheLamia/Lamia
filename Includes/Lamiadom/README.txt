Lamiadom is a section of Lamia-browser to deal with the three main versions of
the Document Object Model.

Lamia Browser's policy is to maintain and work with things based entirely on
how Lamiadom understands the document. This means that this section will 
contain any formatting code for Lamia Browser.

For now, we will mostly just base our provinces on how W3C describes these.

However, be aware that in the future, we will likely will add our own Lamia
Object Model to ensure that some functionality can be made easier to access.
